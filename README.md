# beertracker
Simple script to track the beers I drink

Goals for this project:
 - Help me remember what beers I have been drinking, and how I liked them
 - Keep track of money and alcohol consumption

What this is not
 - Cloud based - I want to host it myself
 - Crowdsourced - I am only interested in my own opions about the beers
 - Public - There are many beer rating sites already
 - Global - I only care about the local watering holes

Outline
 - Simple form to enter a beer I am drinking
 - Store all data in a flat text file
 - Write in Perl
