# beertracker
Simple script to track the beers I drink

Goals for this project:
 - Help me remember what beers I have been drinking, and how I liked them
 - Keep track of money and alcohol consumption

What this is not
 - Cloud based - I want to host it myself
 - Crowdsourced - I am only interested in my own opions about the beers
 - Public - There are many beer rating sites already
 - Global - I only care about the local watering holes

Outline
 - Simple form to enter a beer I am drinking
 - Store all data in a flat text file
 - Write in Perl

Although this is a personal project to scratch my own itch, I might as well
release it under GPL, in case someone else finds this interesting. That does
not mean I am willing to accept feature requests or support users! But I would
like to know if you like this. 


Version 1.0 was released in Feb-2016. It works, and I am using it myself. Of
course there is a small list of features I will want to add some day "real
soon now".
