# Design considerations   TODO - Write more here
#
# Fields that are INTEGER are referring to other tables. If I want to save
# numbers, I use DECIMAL or such. This is a bit dirty, but makes it easier
# to generate forms with suitable magic for such fields.

# TODO - How to handle producers. For now I just create a location entry, but
# that is wasteful for those that only have a name - most of them. Alternatives:
#  - Keep producer name in the brew record, and link to location only if needed
#  - Create a spearate table for producers, with name and link
#    Could add info like when started and stopped, etc

# TODO - Comments. Now they always refer to a glass, which serves to bind them
# into brews, locations, etc. We might as well have a generic Id, and make more
# systematic use of the RefersTo field, so a comment could point directly to
# a person, location (producer?), etc.
